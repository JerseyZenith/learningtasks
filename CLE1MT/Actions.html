		<h2><div class="titleaction">How to take action?</h2>
		</div>
		<p>
		<b>Actions on the individual level</b>
		<br><br>
		1. Have fewer children! One is good, two is enough.
		<br>
		2. Consider adoption!
		<br>
		3. Read, educate yourself about population issues.
		<br>
		4. Reduce your personal consumption: go vegan, limit flying, share your household with others.
		<br>
		5. Educate your teenage child(ren) about sex and contraception early, without taboos
		<br>
		6. Spread your knowledge and concern among your friends and family, raise awareness about overpopulation on social media
		<br>
		7. Donate to family planning programs in your own or other countries – for example to International Planned Parenthood, FP2020 or another equally deserving organization
		<br>
		8. Vote for politicians who acknowledge the detrimental impacts of population growth and propose political solutions
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Actions on the community level</b>
		<br><br>
		1. Join local environmental groups, encouraging them to “connect the dots” between population and the environment and address population issues
		<br>
		2. Write opinion pieces for local newspapers, contact local media sources requesting more reporting on population issues – create demand!
		<br>
		3. Municipalities should set growth management boundaries, discouraging sprawl development on their fringes
		<br>
		4. Towns and cities should purchase surrounding lands, or the development rights to such lands, in order to set them aside as nature preserves and open space
		<br>
		5. City councils should pass resolutions accepting limits to growth, and directing their national governments to develop policies to stabilize or reduce national populations
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Actions on the national level</b>
		<br><br>
		<b>In high fertility developing countries, governments should:</b>
		<br>
		1. Generously fund family planning programs
		<br>
		2. Make modern contraception legal, free and available everywhere, even in remote areas
		<br>
		3. Improve health care to reduce infant and child mortality
		<br>
		4. Restrict child marriage and raise the legal age of marriage (minimum 18 years)
		<br>
		5. Introduce obligatory education as long as possible (minimum until the age of 16), and generously fund the necessary infrastructure
		<br><br>
		<b>In low fertility developed countries, governments should:</b>
		<br><br>
		1. Embrace rather than fight aging and shrinking societies
		<br>
		2. Reorganize pensions and other socio-economic systems to accommodate aging societies
		<br>
		3. Eliminate baby bonuses, government funding for fertility treatments, and other incentives to raise fertility rates
		<br>
		4. Reduce immigration numbers (at least to a level that will stabilize national populations, preferably to one that will lower them) 
		<br>
		5. Reduce resource consumption and pollution through an effective mix of taxes, incentives and regulations
		<br><br>
		<b>In every country, governments should:</b>
		<br><br>
		1. Empower women, assuring equal rights, treatment and opportunities for both genders
		<br>
		2. Provide information and access to reproductive health care, including all types of low cost, safe, effective contraception 
		<br>
		3. Make sterilization free, for men and women, or at least covered under all healthcare plans
		<br>
		4. Legalize abortion without restrictions or social stigma 
		<br>
		5. Integrate family planning and safe motherhood programs into primary health care systems
		<br>
		6. Make population and environmental issues and sex education part of the basic educational curriculum
		<br>
		7. Disincentivize third and further children non-coercively, by limiting government support to the first two children
		<br>
		8. Create a national population policy built around an optimal population size, and work to achieve it
		<br>
		9. Set aside half the national landscape free from intensive development and dedicated to biodiversity protection
		<br><br><br>
		<b>Actions on the global level</b>
		<br><br>
		1. Make “ending population growth” one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals 
		<br>
		2. Greatly increase the amount of foreign aid going to family planning 
		<br>
		3. Change the current foreign aid distribution, giving more support for health and education, while ending international military aid
		<br>
		4. Global religious leaders should approve modern contraception methods and forcefully reject a fatalistic view of procreation
		<br>
		5. Financially support media programs designed to change social norms to bolster family planning, best example is Population Media Center
		<br>
		6. Hold a new global population conference, the first in twenty-five years, to reaffirm the ecological need to limit human numbers and the basic human right to family planning
		<br>
		7. Connect family planning to international environmental and development funding; e.g., include family planning in the Green Climate Fund
		<br>
		8. Create a new global treaty to end population growth, with all countries choosing population targets every half decade with a plan on how to achieve them
		<br>
		9. Create an online platform similar to the ClimateWatch platform, where visitors can see countries’ goals, plans and achievements to date
